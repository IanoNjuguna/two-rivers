            <p>
              No middlemen. No gatekeepers. Just artists, fans, and music.

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-white mb-4">Why We Built This</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              The music industry is broken. Streaming platforms pay artists fractions of a penny per play. 
              Record labels take massive cuts. Independent artists struggle to make a living.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              We believe artists deserve to profit from their work and fans deserve to truly own the music 
              they love. Blockchain technology makes this possible.
            </p>
            <p>
              doba is for the artists who create music because they love it, and the fans who support them 
              because they believe in them.
